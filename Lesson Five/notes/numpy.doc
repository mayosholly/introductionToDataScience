Introduction to Python NumPy:

NumPy is a powerful numerical computing library in Python that provides support for working with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It is a fundamental tool for data scientists, engineers, and researchers, offering efficient and convenient ways to perform numerical operations.

Key Concepts in NumPy:

Arrays:

NumPy's primary data structure is the numpy.ndarray, a powerful array object that can represent vectors, matrices, or higher-dimensional arrays.
Vectorization:

NumPy enables vectorized operations, allowing you to perform operations on entire arrays at once. This results in concise and efficient code.
Broadcasting:

Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes and sizes, making it easier to work with data of varying dimensions.
Mathematical Functions:

NumPy provides a vast array of mathematical functions, including basic arithmetic, trigonometry, linear algebra, statistical operations, and more.
Random Module:

The numpy.random module facilitates the generation of random numbers and sampling from various probability distributions.
